hashtopus
=========

Hashtopus was distributed wrapper around Hashcat hash-cracking software.
It is not developed anymore and considered abandoned. However, it spawned
a spiritual successor, Hashtopolis (formerly known as Hashtopussy).

I encourage you to use it - https://github.com/s3inlc/hashtopolis
